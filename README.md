# machine-learning

So, I've been trying to learn **machine learning** and came across a great book, [Machine Learning in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action) by Peter Harrington. This repository is my notes about the book, with all due credits to the original author of the book. The intention is to get someone quickly on speed with basic ML algorithms and have some out of box implementations of the algorithms that can be used easily.

This will be a condensed material, so, it's good to refer to the abovesaid book for more in-depth understanding.

## requirements
1. Working knowledge of Python 
2. Basic understanding of statistics, probability, algebra and matrices


## classification algorithms
Most basic ML algirthms are classification algorithms. Their use is to classify a piece of new data based on it's features. For instance, we can tell the ethnicity of a person based on their height, skin tone, hair color, etc. Given these details about an unknown person, the algorithm tries to predict which ethnicity the person belongs to.
